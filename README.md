# Hi, I'm Rkanaley

I'm a Director of Marketing at a large contracting firm, but I consider myself more of a business failure expert. I've learned a lot from what hasn't worked, giving me a knowledge base of pitfalls to avoid and some success from the few things that did go right.

- Skills:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Web Development
- Marketing Strategy

- Current Focus:
I'm currently learning SOC 2 compliance requirements for a project called Therapedia, a medical transcription service requiring HIPAA compliance. Since HIPAA is more of a guideline than a rule, I’m pursuing a higher level of compliance to make the project more robust and secure.

- Collaboration:
I’m always open to collaborations where I can add value. While I’ve spent years in web development and coding, my strength lies in identifying growth levers beyond ad spending. I enjoy solving problems programmatically and finding unconventional ways to overcome challenges. Feel free to send me what you're working on.

- Projects:
- [Therapedia](https://therapedia.ai): An AI assistant for mental health professionals that transcribes and summarizes clinical notes.
- [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Rkanaley): Explore my repositories.

- How to Reach Me:
Feel free to open an issue, start a discussion, or email me.

- Pronouns:
I'll leave that up to you. I like surprises.

- Fun Fact:
I have more metal in my left leg than I do bone. I joined the Army twice after the metal became part of my leg due to a car accident. I'm not sure if that proves I’m too stubborn to quit or if it’s a testament to grit. If you're gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough, right? I tend to become obsessed with my goals.
